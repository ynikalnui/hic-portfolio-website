### Assignment Tasks:
1. **Create a profile site on GitHub** that can be used to support you in building your portfolio of work and applying for placements:
   - **Pages required**:
     - **About you**: Include your name, year of study, and award you are studying for. Add a placeholder image where you would put your own image (or use your own image).
     - **Technical interests**: Describe your technical interests related to the area of work you're aiming for. This is not a tutorial section, but should contain a title for the technical interest and 1–2 paragraphs explaining your interest. An appropriate image or placeholder image should be included.
     - **Portfolio**: Showcase relevant projects or work you have completed. Users should be able to view a pop-up window with further information or click a link to go to the project details page.
     - **Project details page**: Provide details about the specific projects or work.
   
2. **Carry out and submit the results of a heuristic evaluation** of your completed site using Nielsen's heuristics:
   - Use the provided **heuristic evaluation template** to document your findings.
   - You must not involve anyone in the usability evaluation of your site. Doing so may constitute an academic offence.
   
3. **Demonstrate through at least one automated conformance test** that you focused on accessibility in your development work and that the final profile site conforms to level AA of the WCAG:
   - You must use the **WAVE plugin** for your conformance test. No other technologies or techniques should be used.
   - You must not involve anyone in the accessibility evaluation of your site. Doing so may constitute an academic offence.

2. Push Changes:
   - After committing, push your changes to the GitHub repository so they are reflected on your GitHub Pages site.

3.Update Your Site:
   - Every time you make changes to your profile, you can preview the updated site on GitHub Pages.
